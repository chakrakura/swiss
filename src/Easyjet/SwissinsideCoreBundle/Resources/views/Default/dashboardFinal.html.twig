                    <b>Swiss switchover to new HR system and payslip processes</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    easyJet has introduced a new global HR system called Workday,
                    which is now live.
                </p>

                <h4>Changes to uMan</h4>
                <p>Here's what you need to know and do:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      You’ll be able to make changes to your personal details in
                      Workday (like contact details and bank information)
                    <li>
                      All accidents will need to be reported through Workday
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You can still update your Significant Others through Staff
                      Travel, but any changes will be through Workday
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you’re M&A, you’ll be able to use Workday to request
                      leave and enter sickness
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Changes to ePayslip</h4>
                <p>Workday will also replace ePayslip. Here's what you need to know:
                  <ul>
                    <li>the last ePayslip will be published at the end of August</li>
                    <li>ePayslip will still be available to view payslips before August 16</li>
                    <li>
                      From September 2016 your payslips and a new Payslip
                      Supplement (for crew) will be available in Workday
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                  To help and support you through these changes, we’ve built a
                  new HR Homepage with lots of ‘How Do I’ guides and information
                  on what’s changed and before you make any changes in Workday,
                  it’s a good idea to visit the pages for advice.
